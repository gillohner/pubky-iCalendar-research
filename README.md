# Pubky iCalendar Integration Specification

## ðŸ”€ Two Approaches Available

This repository now documents **two different approaches** for implementing
calendar functionality in Pubky:

### **[V1: Separate Types](v1-separate-types/)** - Original Specification

Uses dedicated `PubkyAppCalendar`, `PubkyAppEvent`, `PubkyAppAttendee` types
with separate storage paths. Provides strong type safety but requires more
implementation work.

### **[V2: Post Kinds](v2-post-kinds/)** - Current Specification

Extends `PubkyAppPost` with new `kind` enum values (`calendar`, `event`,
`attendee`). Leverages existing post infrastructure for faster implementation
and better integration.

### **[ðŸ“Š Detailed Comparison](COMPARISON.md)**

See the comprehensive comparison document to understand the tradeoffs between
both approaches and decide which is better for your use case.

## Overview

A specification for integrating industry-standard iCalendar protocols (RFC 5545,
RFC 7265, RFC 4791, RFC 5546, RFC 7986, RFC 9073) into the Pubky ecosystem,
enabling decentralized calendar functionality while maintaining compatibility
with existing CalDAV clients and calendar standards.

## Background

This project researches how events and calendars can be implemented on Pubky.
The existing iCalendar standards and their extensions provide a robust
foundation with comprehensive event management features. These standards have
been extensively tested in real-world scenarios across diverse calendar
applications, making them an ideal basis for a decentralized calendar system
with simple extensions.

By building upon established RFC specifications, we can potentially enable
seamless integration with existing calendar workflows while benefiting from
Pubky's decentralization. This research analyzes existing iCalendar standards,
documents their applicability to the Pubky ecosystem, and identifies which
specifications are most suitable for implementationâ€”with consideration for
future protocol expansions.

The documentation includes mentions of a CalDAV bridge to implement Pubky-based
calendar management in existing calendar applications like Outlook or
Thunderbird. For the prototype phase, there is no plan to actually implement
this. I decided to document my ideas of how it could look, as the core structure
is designed with such a bridge in mind. Keeping this in mind for later stages
could enable deeper integration into existing workflows, as mentioned before.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

### Version-Specific Folders

| Folder                                       | Description                         | Status                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **[v1-separate-types/](v1-separate-types/)** | Original spec using dedicated types | Complete                  |
| **[v2-post-kinds/](v2-post-kinds/)**         | Current spec using Post kinds       | Complete + Latest updates |

**Each version folder contains:**

| File                          | Description                                               |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pubky-ical-specification.md` | Core technical specification (different for each version) |
| `nexus-endpoints.md`          | Nexus API endpoints (different for each version)          |
| `event-examples.md`           | Example calendar data (different structure per version)   |

### Shared Architecture Files (Root Level)

These files are shared between both versions as they describe general
architecture and frontend scope:
