# Pubky iCalendar Integration Specification

A comprehensive specification for integrating industry-standard iCalendar
protocols (RFC 5545, RFC 7265, RFC 4791, RFC 5546, RFC 7986, RFC 9073) into the
Pubky ecosystem, enabling decentralized calendar functionality while maintaining
compatibility with existing CalDAV clients and calendar standards.

## Background

This project researches how Events and Calendars can be implemented on Pubky
infrastructure. The existing iCalendar standards and their extensions provide a
robust foundation with comprehensive event management features. These standards
have been extensively tested in real-world scenarios across diverse calendar
applications, making them an ideal foundation for decentralized calendar
systems.

By building upon established RFC specifications, we can potentially enable
seamless integration with existing calendar workflows while leveraging the
benefits of Pubky's decentralized architecture. This research analyzes existing
iCalendar standards, documents their applicability to the Pubky ecosystem, and
identifies which specifications are most suitable for implementation - with
consideration for future protocol expansions.

The Documentation includes mentions of a Caldav Bridge to implement Pubky based
Calendar management in existing Calendar applications like Outlook, Thunderbird
and such. For the prototype-phase there is no plan to actually implement this. I
decided to document my ideas of how they could look like as the core structure
is designed with such a birdge for these to be
