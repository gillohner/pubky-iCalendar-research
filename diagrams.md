### Data Flow for a CalDAV Bridge

```
Note:
Below Diagram is an example outlining the flow for a potential CalDAV client. I currently
don't have a plan to implement this during the prototyping phase. The idea is
that this could be created at a later stage based on the curent core
specification.
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant HS as Homeserver
    participant N as Nexus Indexer
    participant DB as Neo4j Database
    participant CB as CalDAV Bridge
    participant C as Calendar Client
    
    U->>HS: 1. Store jCal JSON files
    HS->>N: 2. Watch & notify changes
    N->>DB: 3. Index calendar data
    N->>DB: 4. Generate feeds
    
    Note over C,CB: Access Patterns
    CB->>N: Fetch jCal data
    CB->>C: Translate to .ics format
```

1. **Storage**: Users store PubkyAppVCalendar, PubkyAppVEvent,
   PubkyAppVAttendee, PubkyAppVAlarm, ... files as jCal files on their
   homeservers at `/pub/pubky.app/...`
2. **Indexing**: Nexus watches homeserver paths, indexes calendar data into
   Neo4j graph database
3. **Aggregation**: Nexus generates feeds based on follows, tags, date ranges,
   and social signals, ... (Exact endpoints TBD)
4. **Access**: Clients query Nexus REST API for aggregated feeds.
5. **Bridging**: CalDAV bridge translates between jCal JSON and .ics format for
   legacy client compatibility and maps iTip functionality to Pubky Homeserver
   Documents.
